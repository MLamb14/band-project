# band-project
Band name generator

Overview:
This project was made with the intention of developing a few beginner skills. Firstly, to tell you what it does:
On the page, you are able to generate a new random band name using large arrays of adjectives and nouns. In its default state, when you click generate, the band name created begins with an adjective and ends with a noun. Additional options are available in a drop down that lets the user have just adjectives or just nouns.
